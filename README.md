**Film Database**

I've tried to build a Film Database using Laravel. Laravel basic auth was used for authentications. Feel free to clone this repo for your work!

## Functionalities

Youâ€™ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. The registered users can create a new film.
2. The registered users can post comments.
3. The guests need to Login or Register to gain the full control.

##Future Plans:
1. Implement photo upload functions for the films.
2. Research and use other authentications other than Laravel basic auth.
3. Create filters to sort by Year & Country.
